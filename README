ExtUtils/configPL version 0.01
==============================

ExtUtils::configPL - Perl extension to automagiclly configure perl scripts

This module is used to add configuration information to a perl script, and
is meant to be used with the C<ExtUtils::MakeMaker> module.

C<ExtUtils::configPL> is not a "normal" Perl extension. It does add or
encapsulate functionality to your script, but it filters the script,
replacing I<tags> with items from the C<Config> module, writing the resulting
script to a new file.

The normal use for this module is to add the "shebang" line as the first line
of a script.

    use ExtUtils::ConfigPL;
    <<--startperl-->> -w

would be replaced with:

    #/usr/local/bin/perl -w

(or where ever your perl executable is located.)
